        BMR stands for Basic Metabolic Rate, which means how much energy your body needs to maintain stability. The first BMR formula was developed in 1918-1919. It was called the "Harris-Benedict" equation, it takes the weight multiplied by 13.7516, height in centimeters and multiplied by 5.0033, age multiplied by 6.755, and you add 66.473 or 655.0955 depending on the gender. <br />
        <br />
        The formula would look something like this: <br /> <br />
        <ul>Men: (13.7516 x Weight) + (5.0033 * Height) - (6.755 * Age) + 66.473</ul>
        <ul>Women: (13.7516 x Weight) + (5.0033 * Height) - (6.755 * Age) + 655.0955</ul> 
        <br /> 
        It was later developed in 1984 by Roza and Shizgal. It's known as the Revised Harris-Benedict Equation. <br /> <br />
        <ul>Men: (13.397 * Weight) + (4.799 * Height) - (5.677 * Age) + 88.362</ul>
        <ul>Women: (9.247 * Weight) + (3.098 x Height) - (4.330 * Age) + 447.593</ul> 
        <br /> 
        In 1990, the equation was once again revised but by Mifflin and St Jeor. This website uses this equation and it's called the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. It's the <b>most accurate</b> out of the 3.
        <ul>Men: (10 * Weight) + (6.25 * Height) - (5 * Age) + 5</ul>
        <ul>Women: (10 * Weight) + (6.25 * Height) - (5 * Age) - 161</ul> 
        <br /> 
        In brief, the equation appeared from a study by James Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict, giving the first equation the name of "Harris-Benedict Equation." You can see the traces of the first equations spread across the 3, however a couple of things changed. The equations evolved in accuracy.
